-- 1. Create a table called employees with the following structure?
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    age INT CHECK (age >= 18),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2) DEFAULT 30000.00
);

select * from employees

-- Q2. Explain the purpose of constraints and how they help maintain data integrity in a database. Provide examples of common types of 
 -- constraints.
-- Ans: Purpose of Constraints in a Database--

-- Constraints are essential rules enforced on data columns in a table to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data within the database.
-- They play a crucial role in maintaining data integrity by restricting the type, range, and format of the data that can be inserted into 
-- the database. Here are some of the key purposes of constraints:

-- 1 Data Integrity: Constraints ensure that the data stored in the database is accurate and consistent.
-- 2 Data Validation: Constraints validate data before it is inserted or updated, preventing invalid data from being stored.
-- 3 Referential Integrity: Constraints enforce relationships between tables, ensuring that the references between tables are valid and consistent.
-- 4 Ensuring Uniqueness: Constraints can enforce the uniqueness of data in specified columns, preventing duplicate values.

-- Common Types of Constraints:--------------

-- PRIMARY KEY Constraint
-- Purpose: Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
-- Example:
-- CREATE TABLE employees (
--     emp_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
--     emp_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
-- );

-- FOREIGN KEY Constraint
-- Purpose: Ensures referential integrity between two tables by creating a link between the primary key of one table and the foreign key of another table.
-- Example:
-- CREATE TABLE orders (
--     order_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
--     customer_id INT,
--     FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
-- );

-- UNIQUE Constraint
-- Purpose: Ensures that all values in a column are unique.
-- Example:
-- CREATE TABLE users (
--     user_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
--     email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE
-- );

-- NOT NULL Constraint
-- Purpose: Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value.
-- Example:
-- CREATE TABLE products (
--     product_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
--     product_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
-- );

-- CHECK Constraint
-- Purpose: Ensures that all values in a column satisfy a specific condition.
-- Example:
-- CREATE TABLE employees (
--     emp_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
--     age INT CHECK (age >= 18)
-- );

-- DEFAULT Constraint
-- Purpose: Provides a default value for a column when no value is specified.
-- Example:
-- CREATE TABLE employees (
--     emp_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
--     salary DECIMAL(10, 2) DEFAULT 30000.00

-- 3.Why would you apply the NOT NULL constraint to a column? Can a primary key contain NULL values? Justify your answer.

-- Why Apply the NOT NULL Constraint---------------------------------
-- Ensures Data: Ensures essential data is present.
-- Prevents Nulls: Avoids null values in critical fields.
-- Simplifies Logic: Simplifies application logic by avoiding NULL checks

-- Can a Primary Key Contain NULL Values--------------------------------
-- No, A primary key must be unique, Ensures referential integrity and must uniquely identify each record.

-- 4. Explain the steps and SQL commands used to add or remove constraints on an existing table. Provide an example for both adding and
 --   removing a constraint.
 
 -- Adding a Constraint-------------
--  ALTER TABLE table_name
--  ADD CONSTRAINT constraint_name PRIMARY KEY (column1, column2, ...);
--  ALTER TABLE employees
--  ADD CONSTRAINT pk_employee PRIMARY KEY (employee_id);

-- Removing a Constraint-------------------------------------
-- ALTER TABLE table_name
-- DROP CONSTRAINT constraint_name;
-- ALTER TABLE employees
-- DROP CONSTRAINT pk_employee;

--  Q5 Explain the consequences of attempting to insert, update, or delete data in a way that violates constraints.Provide an example of an
--  error message that might occur when violating a constraint.

-- Consequences of Violating Constraints

-- 1. PRIMARY KEY Constraint:
-- Insert: If you try to insert a duplicate value into a column with a PRIMARY KEY constraint, you'll get an error.
-- Update: If an update operation results in a duplicate key value, the update will fail.
-- Delete: Deleting a primary key value can affect related tables if foreign keys are involved.

-- 2. FOREIGN KEY Constraint:
-- Insert: Trying to insert a value that doesn't exist in the referenced table will result in an error.
-- Update: Updating a foreign key value to something that doesn't exist in the referenced table will fail.
-- Delete: Deleting a row that is referenced by a foreign key in another table will fail unless the foreign key constraint is set to
--  CASCADE.

-- 3. UNIQUE Constraint:
-- Insert/Update: Attempting to insert or update a value that already exists in a column with a UNIQUE constraint will result in an error.

-- 4. CHECK Constraint:
-- Insert/Update: Trying to insert or update a value that doesn't satisfy the CHECK condition will fail.

--  Example---

CREATE TABLE employees (
   employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
   name VARCHAR(100),
   department_id INT
);

INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, name, department_id)
VALUES (1, 'Ajay Jangra', 101);

INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, name, department_id)
VALUES (1, 'Ajay Kumar', 102);

-- ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "employees_pkey"
-- DETAIL: Key (employee_id)=(1) already exists.

-- 6. You created a products table without constraints as follows:

CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT,
    product_name VARCHAR(50),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2));
    
-- Now, you realise that?
-- : The product_id should be a primary keyQ
-- : The price should have a default value of 50.00

-- Ans. We have already created the table but we want to update the table format then we will use the alter commands.Pls find below the 
-- quiries for this regarding...

-- Adding PRIMARY KEY constraint
ALTER TABLE products
ADD CONSTRAINT pk_product PRIMARY KEY (product_id);

-- Setting default value for price column
ALTER TABLE products
ALTER COLUMN price SET DEFAULT 50.00;

drop table products;

-- Q7. You have two tables:

create table students(
student_id int primary key,
student_name varchar(30),
class_id int);

Insert into students ( student_id, student_name, class_id )
value ( 1, 'Alice' , 101),
	  (2,'Bob', 102),
      (3, 'Charlie', 101);

Select * from students;  

Create table classes (
class_id int primary key, 
class_name varchar(30));
    
Insert into classes (  class_id,   class_name)
Values (101, 'Match'),
       (102,'Science'), 
       (103,'History');
       
Select * from classes;  
Select * from students;  

-- Write a query to fetch the student_name and class_name for each student using an INNER JOIN.
  
SELECT 
    Students.student_name, 
    Classes.class_name
FROM 
    Students
INNER JOIN 
	Classes
ON 
    Students.class_id = Classes.class_id;
       
-- 8. Consider the following three tables:

order_id int primary key,
order_date date ,
customer_id int ); 

insert into orders ( order_id, order_date, customer_id)
            value ( 1, '2024-01-01', 101),
				  (2, '2024-01-03', 102)
                    
select * from orders;    
                    
create table customers(
customer_id int primary key,
customer_name varchar(30) );    

insert into customers ( customer_id, customer_name)
values (101,'Alice'), (102, 'Bob');

select * from customers;   

create table products (
product_id int primary key,
product_name varchar(40),
order_id  int );

insert into products ( product_id, product_name, order_id )
values (1, 'Laptop', 1), ( 2,'Phone',null);

select * from products;   
drop table products;
-- Write a query that shows all order_id, customer_name, and product_name, ensuring that all products are
-- listed even if they are not associated with an order 
-- Hint: (use INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN).

SELECT 
	o.order_id, c.customer_name, p.product_name 
FROM
	Products p 
LEFT JOIN 
	Orders o ON p.order_id = o.order_id 
LEFT JOIN 
	Customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;

   select * from products;
   
   
  --  Write a query to find the total sales amount for each product using an INNER JOIN and the SUM() function.
             
SELECT 
    p.product_name, 
    SUM(s.amount) AS total_sales_amount
FROM 
    sales s
INNER JOIN

-- ----------------------------------------------Normalisation & CTE---------------------------------------

-- 1. First Normal Form (1NF):
--  a. Identify a table in the Sakila database that violates 1NF. Explain how you
--  would normalize it to achieve 1NF.

-- Violation of 1NF:
CREATE TABLE address (
    address_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    address VARCHAR(50),
    address2 VARCHAR(50),
    district VARCHAR(50),
    city_id INT,
    postal_code VARCHAR(10),
    phone VARCHAR(50) -- Multiple phone numbers stored as comma-separated values
);

-- Normalization to 1NF:

CREATE TABLE phone_numbers (
    phone_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    address_id INT,
    phone VARCHAR(20),
    FOREIGN KEY (address_id) REFERENCES address(address_id)
);

-- 2. Second Normal Form (2NF):
--  a. Choose a table in Sakila and describe how you would determine whether it is in 2NF. 
--  If it violates 2NF, explain the steps to normalize it.

-- Violation of 2NF:

CREATE TABLE film (
    film_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(50),
    store_id INT,
    store_name VARCHAR(50) -- Partially dependent on store_id
);

-- Normalization to 2NF:

CREATE TABLE store (
    store_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    store_name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE film (
    film_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(50),
    store_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (store_id) REFERENCES store(store_id)
);

-- 3. Third Normal Form (3NF):
--  a. Identify a table in Sakila that violates 3NF. Describe the transitive dependencies 
--  present and outline the steps to normalize the table to 3NF.

-- Violation of 3NF:
CREATE TABLE payment (
    payment_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    customer_name VARCHAR(50) -- Transitively dependent on customer_id
);

-- Normalization to 3NF:

CREATE TABLE customer (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE payment (
    payment_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customer(customer_id)
);

-- 4. Normalization Process:
--  a. Take a specific table in Sakila and guide through the process of normalizing it from the initial 
--  unnormalized form up to at least 2NF.

-- Unnormalized Form:

CREATE TABLE CustomerOrders (
    customer_id INT,
    customer_name VARCHAR(50),
    orders VARCHAR(255) -- Orders stored as a comma-separated list
);

-- 1NF: Remove repeating groups:

CREATE TABLE Customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
